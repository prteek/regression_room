Being in the same Local authority may affect neighbouring MSOAs introducing correlations in their data. \nIt can be possible that age has a confounding effect on Rentership via Occupation. Majority of Professional and Managers may likely be older than associates and this may mean that they were able to purchase a house earlier in their careers/life and now represent a smaller proportion of rental cohort.  Adjusting for age gives an apples-to-apples comparison of rentership preference among people pursuing different occupations but are in boradly same phases of their life.  The adjustment is made by including the proportion of full-time employed HRPs in an MSOA engaged in a particular profession falling in one of the following age bands: \n\naged 15 years and under\naged 16 to 24 years\naged 25 to 34 years\naged 35 to 49 years\naged 50 to 64 years\naged 65 years and over\n\nNote:  This adjustment is inexact since the data is available for all people in full time occupation rather than just HRP (which is the unit of measurement in tenure data). This means that likely an HRP would be an older person, the counts in age dataset include other members of the household which are possibly younger, creating a slight disconnect between the 2 datasets.  It is neverthless instructive to use this information as the downsides due to excluding this information outweigh downsided due to (incorrectly) including it.\nSince, the interest lies in proportion of rentership for each occupation, per occupation totals for each MSOA are added to the dataset.\n\n\nFilter\nCurrent data only includes measurements from household reference persons (HRP) in full time employment a week before census.

Let \\(\\mathbf{y} = (y_1,....,y_n)^T\\) be the observed values, then the likelihood function for the distribution is:\n\\[\nP(\\mathbf{Y}=\\mathbf{y}) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} f(y_i|\\theta) = L(\\theta|y)\n\\]\nAs can be seen likelihood is about considering parameter \\(\\theta\\) as random and data \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) as fixed (hence the notation \\(L(\\theta|y)\\)). This is as opposed to a joint density function where \\(\\theta\\) are fixed and \\(y\\) are random.  Effectively though likelihood is still the probability of observed data \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) for a specified value of the parameter(s) i.e. \\(p(\\mathbf{y}|\\theta)\\) but the key distinction is that likelihood changes as \\(\\theta\\) changes.\n\n\nContinuous RV case\nWhen the random variables are continuous (with probability density \\(f(y|\\theta)\\)), in practice one can measure data with limited precision. When a value \\(y_i\\) is observed it effectively indicates an observation in the range \\([y_i^l, y_i^u]\\), where \\(y_i^l\\) and \\(y_i^u\\) are lower and upper bounds of precision limit.  Using which we can reason that probability of observed value is a concept defined over an interval:\n\\[\nP(Y_i=y_i) = P(y_i^l&lt;=y_i&lt;=y_i^u) = \\int_{y_i^l}^{y_i^u} f(u|\\theta) \\, du \\approx f(y_i|\\theta) \\delta_i\n\\]\nsuch that \\(\\delta_i = y_i^u-y_i^l\\), which does not depend on \\(\\theta\\) and is related to the precision of measurement.  And, the likelihood becomes:\n\\[\nL(\\theta|y) \\approx \\prod_{i=1}^{n} f(y_i|\\theta) \\prod_{i=1}^{n}\\delta_i\n\\]\nGiven we know that \\(\\delta_i\\) does not depend on \\(\\theta\\), the last term can be ignored and the likelihood then becomes same as in the discrete case."

Its likelihood is:\n\\[\nL(p|y) = \\binom{n}{y}p^y(1-p)^{n-y}\n\\]\nThe maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of \\(p\\) results in the largest probability of observed data. The value at which the maximum occurs is called the maximum likelihood estimate and is denoted as \\(\\hat{p}\\).\nOften, it is simpler to maximise the log of likelihood function \\(l(\\theta|y) = log(L(\\theta|y))\\), considering that log is a monotonic increasing function so maximising either should result in the exact same estimate \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\).\nTo find the solution for \\(\\hat{p}\\) in our binomial case, we can start by defining the log-likelihood:\n\\[\nl(p|y) = log(\\binom{n}{y}) + ylog(p) + (n-y)log(1-p)\n\\]\nA typical calculus approach to maximising this function would be to take the derivative of this log-likelihood w.r.t. parameters of interest and set it to 0.  Worth noting that the derivative is called score function and denoted as \\(u(\\theta)\\) in general. For binomial we have:\n\\[\nu(p) = \\frac{d}{dp}l(p|y) = \\frac{y}{p} - \\frac{n-y}{1-p}\n\\]\nTo get the maximum likelihood estimate \\(\\hat{p}\\) we solve for \\(u(p) = 0\\) and get \\(\\hat{p} = y/n\\)."

    "text": "Fisher Information (uncertainty)\nSome measure of uncertainty is desirable here to be able to rely on the estimate. This is given by Fisher information:\n\\[\nI(\\theta) = var(u(\\theta)) = -\\mathbb{E}[\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial \\theta \\partial \\theta^T}l(\\theta)]\n\\]\nThe double derivative part here implies the rate of change of score itself.  At (or near) the maximum values of log-likelihood, a large value of \\(I(\\theta)\\) effectively indicates a large rate of change of score. Which means that the maximum is clearly defined (curvature of log-likelihood is large).\nUnder regularity conditions, the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the parameter \\(\\theta\\) , denoted as \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) , is asymptotically unbiased and normally distributed. That is: \\[\n\\hat{\\theta} \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(\\theta, \\frac{1}{I(\\theta)}\\right).\n\\] and this means that \\(var(\\hat{\\theta}) = I^{-1}(\\theta)\\). Which gives us the uncertainty on parameter estimate itself.  This makes intuitive sense, when Fisher information is high (clearly defined maximum and high curvature of log-likelihood), then the uncertainty in parameter estimate should be low.\n\nFisher information for Binomial\nNow, in the Fisher information, the expectation is w.r.t. data. Consider the following for binomial distributed data:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n    \\frac{d}{dp}l(p|y) = \\frac{y}{p} - \\frac{n-y}{1-p} \\\\\n    \\frac{d^2}{dp^2}l(p|y)l(p|y) = -\\frac{y}{p^2} - \\frac{n-y}{(1-p)^2} \\\\\n    \\mathbb{E}[\\frac{d^2}{dp^2}l(p|y)l(p|y)] = \\mathbb{E}[-\\frac{y}{p^2} - \\frac{n-y}{(1-p)^2}] \\\\\n    and, \\mathbb{E}[y] = np \\\\\n    \\mathbb{E}[\\frac{d^2}{dp^2}l(p|y)l(p|y)] = -\\frac{n}{p} - \\frac{n}{(1-p)} \\\\\n    I(p) = - \\mathbb{E}[\\frac{d^2}{dp^2}l(p|y)l(p|y)] = \\frac{n}{p} + \\frac{n}{(1-p)} \\\\\n    I(p) = \\frac{n}{p(1-p)}\n\n\\end{align}\\]\nSo, the larger the \\(n\\) (sample size) the greater is Fisher information and lesser uncertainty about the maxima point of score function. Similarly, for same \\(n\\) more extreme values of \\(p\\) will enable estimation of parameter with greater degree of confidence due to higher Fisher Information. Intuitively, this is because extreme values in data will be observed (lots of 1s or lots or 0s).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffect of Fisher information on log-likelihood\nWe can also illustrate the effect on score (log-likelihood) becoming more defined with higher Fisher information (due to higher \\(n\\)) with same choices as above plot.  Essentially we consider 2 binomial datasets one with \\(n=25, y=10\\) and another with \\(n=50, y=20\\) where \\(y\\) is observed counts of successes.\n\nloglik &lt;- function(x, y, n) lchoose(n, y) + y * log(x) + (n - y) * log(1 - x)\n\ncurve(\n  loglik(x, y = 10, n = 25),\n  0,\n  1,\n  lty = 1,\n  xlab = 'p',\n  ylab = 'Log-likelihood',\n  main = 'Log-likelihood of Binomial distribution'\n)\ncurve(loglik(x, y = 20, n = 50), 0, 1, add = TRUE, lty = 2)\ngrid()\nlegend(\"topright\", legend = c(\"n=25\", \"n=50\"), lty = c(1, 2))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe maximum can be noticed at \\(p=0.4\\) (equal to \\(n/y\\) in both cases as derived earlier). For larger sample size \\(n=50\\) the curvature of log-likelihood is greater as there is more information available.  For our binomial example we maximised the log-likelihood function analytically earlier. It was a convenient exercise, however it is not always possible to analytically maximise log-likelihood and estimate parameters."

Consider \\(\\theta_0\\) as an initial guess for \\(\\theta\\), then an update is made using: \\[\n\\theta_1 = \\theta_0 - H^{-1}(\\theta_0) J(\\theta_0)\n\\] Where,  \\(H(\\theta) = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial \\theta \\partial \\theta^T}l(\\theta)\\) is the Hessian matrix of second derivatives of log-likelihood w.r.t. \\(\\theta\\) .  \\(J(\\theta) = \\frac{d}{d\\theta}l(\\theta)\\) is the Jacobian matrix of derivatives of log-likelihood w.r.t. \\(\\theta\\) .\nThis method works well, provided the log-likelihood is smooth and convex around the maximum and the initial value is reasonably chosen, but is not a guaranteed solution for all maximisation problems (such as when maximum is on boundary of parameter space or when there are several local maximums). \n\nNormal example\nTo develop intuition on this method consider a Normal distribution: \\[\nf(x \\mid \\mu, \\sigma^2) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x - \\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)\n\\]\nIts log-likelihood can be written as \\[\nl(\\mu) = -\\frac{n}{2} \\log(2\\pi\\sigma^2) - \\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\mu)^2.\n\\]\nWe calculate the first and second derivatives of log-likelihood\n\\[\\begin{align}\nl'(\\mu) = \\frac{\\partial l(\\mu)}{\\partial \\mu} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma^2} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\mu) \\\\\n\nl''(\\mu) = \\frac{\\partial^2 l(\\mu)}{\\partial \\mu^2} = -\\frac{n}{\\sigma^2}\n\n\\end{align}\\]\nThen we perform the Newton Raphson update\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\mu^{(t+1)} = \\mu^{(t)} - \\frac{l'(\\mu^{(t)})}{l''(\\mu^{(t)})} \\\\\n\\mu^{(t+1)} = \\mu^{(t)} - \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\sigma^2} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\mu^{(t)})}{-\\frac{n}{\\sigma^2}} \\\\\n\\mu^{(t+1)} = \\mu^{(t)} + \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\mu^{(t)})}{n} \\\\\n\\mu^{(t+1)} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\n\\end{align}\\]\nThus, in this case, the Newton-Raphson method directly converges to the sample mean \\(\\bar{x}\\) , which is the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) for \\(\\mu\\).\n\n\nBinomial solution\nLet’s now revert back to our Binomial distribution setting. We can perform log-likelihhod maximisation with Newton Raphson using R. Note that we need to minimize \\(-l(\\theta)\\) because nlm minimizes and doesn’t maximize.\n\nn &lt;- 25\ny &lt;- 10\nf &lt;- function(x) -loglik(x, y, n)\nmle &lt;- nlm(f, 0.5, hessian = TRUE)\n\nWarning in log(x): NaNs produced\n\n\nWarning in nlm(f, 0.5, hessian = TRUE): NA/Inf replaced by maximum positive\nvalue\n\n\nWarning in log(x): NaNs produced\n\n\nWarning in nlm(f, 0.5, hessian = TRUE): NA/Inf replaced by maximum positive\nvalue\n\n\nWe use an initial value of \\(p=0.5\\) and set hessian to TRUE to be able to calculate standard errors of the estimate using it.\nAt the MLE \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) , the Hessian \\(H(\\hat{\\theta})\\) is often used as an estimate for the Fisher information. (since both are effectively double derivative of log-likelihood). We have \\[\nI(\\hat{\\theta}) \\approx -H(\\hat{\\theta})\n\\] We have seen earlier that the variance of parameter is the inverse of Fisher information, which gives us \\[\n\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\theta}) = I^{-1}(\\theta) \\approx [-H(\\hat{\\theta})]^{-1}\n\\]\nHence, the inverse of the Hessian at the optimum is equal to the variance of the estimate.  Note: - sign is excluded since we’re working with -log-likelihood in nlm\n\ncat(paste(\"Numerical estimate of p:\", round(mle$estimate, 2)))\n\nNumerical estimate of p: 0.4\n\nest &lt;- paste(\"Estimated variance of p:\", round(1 / mle$hessian, 4))\nact &lt;- paste(\"Actual variance variance of p:\", round(0.4 * (1 - 0.4) / n, 4))\ncat(paste(est, act, sep = '\\n'))\n\nEstimated variance of p: 0.0096\nActual variance variance of p: 0.0096\n\n\nThis is a useful toolkit to have when working with estimations and maximum likelihood."

    "text": "Analysis\n\nComparing recent vs old movies\nTo simplify the analysis we can consider more recent releases (2013-2023) and compare them to releases from much older timeframe (1990-2000).  The runtime distributions for movies in these 2 categories is different although not significantly (visually).\n\ntestset &lt;- yearly_top_movies %&gt;%\n    mutate(\n    label = case_when(\n      release_year &gt;= 2013 ~ \"recent\",\n      release_year &lt;= 2000 ~ \"old\",\n      TRUE ~ \"other\"\n    )) %&gt;% filter(label != \"other\")\n\nggplot(testset, aes(x=runtime_mins, fill=label)) + geom_density(alpha=0.3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we can compare runtimes between two periods. It would have been a straightforward exercise in testing the hypothesis of difference of means using a t-test had the distributions of runtimes been more normally distributed. \nAdditionally, the cutoff chosen for old (&lt;= 2000) and recent (&gt;=2013) are arbitrary. We would ideally want a more comprehensive statement about movie runtimes increasing over the years. \nNeverthless, as a preliminary (and simple) analysis we can use bootstrap to compare means of runtimes in the above groups.\n\nlibrary(boot)\n\n# Define a function to calculate the difference of means\ndiff_mean &lt;- function(data, indices) {\n  # Resample the data\n  resampled_data &lt;- data[indices, ]\n\n  # Calculate means for each group\n  mean_group1 &lt;- mean(resampled_data$runtime_mins[resampled_data$label == \"old\"])\n  mean_group2 &lt;- mean(resampled_data$runtime_mins[resampled_data$label == \"recent\"])\n\n  # Return the difference of means\n  return(mean_group2 - mean_group1)\n}\n\nset.seed(123)\nbootstrap_results &lt;- boot(data = testset, statistic = diff_mean, R = 1000)\n\n# Print bootstrap results\nprint(bootstrap_results)\n\n\nORDINARY NONPARAMETRIC BOOTSTRAP\n\n\nCall:\nboot(data = testset, statistic = diff_mean, R = 1000)\n\n\nBootstrap Statistics :\n    original     bias    std. error\nt1* 9.697248 0.06394496    3.174053\n\n# Plot bootstrap distribution\nplot(bootstrap_results)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Calculate confidence interval for the difference of means\nci &lt;- boot.ci(bootstrap_results, type = \"perc\")\nprint(ci)\n\nBOOTSTRAP CONFIDENCE INTERVAL CALCULATIONS\nBased on 1000 bootstrap replicates\n\nCALL : \nboot.ci(boot.out = bootstrap_results, type = \"perc\")\n\nIntervals : \nLevel     Percentile     \n95%   ( 3.502, 15.736 )  \nCalculations and Intervals on Original Scale\n\n\nIf we bootstrap the mean of movie times and take the difference between means of recent release years from old, there is evidence that blockbuster movies are getting longer in recent years, and the difference can be up to 10 min on average and can be expected to be between 4 min and 16 min. \nSo on your next visit to the theatre make sure to get some extra popcorn !!!\n\n\nEstimating effect of time\nIn the want of better precision in identifying the effect of time on movie runtimes, we can formulate a regression problem and estimate the effect of year.\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot above partly confirms our intuition about the increasing trend of runtime.\n\nlmod &lt;- lm(runtime_mins ~ release_year, yearly_top_movies)\nsummary(lmod)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = runtime_mins ~ release_year, data = yearly_top_movies)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-43.369 -19.617   0.488  16.422  77.834 \n\nCoefficients:\n              Estimate Std.

Considering our previous finding on average between 1995 and 2018 the runtime increased by approx. 10 min. From the regression estimate the increase is 0.3791 * (2018-1995) = 8.7 min. \nWe can certainly run some diagnostics to be sure of our model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe residuals appear to have no pattern with fitted values and also have fairly constant variance. There are no significantly high leverage points or outliers.  However, the errors are not quite normally distributed.  This can be ignored by relying on large sample size and the fact that other diagnostics are fine.  But, we shall check if just in case any transformation of runtime_mins may help.\n\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(MASS))\nboxcox(lmod, lambda=seq(-1,1,by=0.1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Box-Cox transformation check above hints that there may be some benefit if we used log-transformation (since lambda approximately 0). This thread does not materialise into anything meaningful as upon transformation, the diagnostics do not change materially and the effect size of release_year is practically the same (0.32% per year, 0.38 min/year on base of 119 min). So we will not use any transformation in our model.\nThere may also be some degree of autocorrelation among residuals due to the fact that we’re working with timeseries data. We can test for this autocorrelation and handle it if necessary.\n\n\nAuto-correlation among residuals:  0.01\n\n\n\n    Durbin-Watson test\n\ndata:  runtime_mins ~ release_year\nDW = 1.982, p-value = 0.4126\nalternative hypothesis: true autocorrelation is greater than 0\n\n\nThere doesn’t appear to be significant autocorrelation and other model diagnotics appear to be fine."

    "text": "Methodology\nFirst we shall model the process as a Markov chain to see how well the approach predicts future user counts.  Subsequently, to validate MC approach and rethink the problem setup in want of simplification, we shall look to model the time-series as a regression problem. We shall do this respecting the mechanics of transition and see how far this can get us in terms of analysing and controlling the process.\nAt day d (d = 1, 2, … ) of a user’s lifetime, the user can be in one of the following 7 (mutually-exclusive) states: \n\nnew : learners who are experiencing Duolingo for the first time ever\ncurrent : learners active today, who were also active in the past week\nreactivated : learners active today, who were also active in the past month (but not the past week)\nresurrected : learners active today, who were last active &gt;30 days ago\nat_risk_wau (at risk weekly active users) : learners who have been active within the past week, but not today\nat_risk_mau (at risk monthly active users) : learners who were active within the past month, but not the past week\ndormant : learners who have been inactive for at least 30 days\n\nA brief overview of how these states are related is below:\n\n\n\nUser states and transitions\n\n\nThe transition acronyms are defined below:\n\nNURR : New User Retention Rate (The proportion of day 1 learners who return on day 2)\nCURR : Current User Retention Rate (This is not a 100%. Not all of current users stay active every day since people forget to complete a lesson, or have technical difficulties, or just want to take a break)\nRURR : Reactivated User Retention rate (The proportion of at_risk_mau who became active today)\nSURR : Resurrected User Retention rate (The proportion of dormant users who became active today)\niWAURR : The proportion of at_risk_wau users who became active today\n\nAs is evident, these quantities (along with others) are what will become the elements of Transition matrix (M), that we discuss next.\nIn keeping with the definition chart above, the next step is to consider user behaviour as a Markov chain.  Let M be a transition matrix associated with this Markov process: m(i, j) = P(s_j | s_i) are the probabilities that a user moves to state s_j right after being at state s_i. The matrix M is learned from the historical data.\nAssuming that user behavior is stationary (independent of time), the matrix M fully describes the states of all users in the future.\nSuppose that the vector u_0 of length 7 contains the counts of users in certain states on a given day (say day 0). According to the Markov model, on the next day (day 1), we expect to have the following number of users (u_1) in respective states:\n\n\n\nState transition counts estimation\n\n\nApplying this multiplication recursively, we can derive the number of users in any states on any arbitrary day t &gt; 0 in the future (call this vector u_t).\nNow, having u_t calculated, we can determine DAU, WAU and MAU values on day t:\n\nDAU_t = #New_t + #Current_t + #Reactivated_t + #Resurrected_t\nWAU_t = DAU_t + #AtRiskWau_t\nMAU_t = DAU_t + #AtRiskWau_t + #AtRiskMau_t\n\nFinally, here’s the algorithm outline:\n\nFor each prediction day t = 1, …, T, calculate the expected number of new users #New_1, …, #New_T.\nFor each lifetime day of each user, assign one of the 7 states.\nCalculate the transition matrix M from the historical data.\nCalculate initial state counts u_0 corresponding to day t=0.\nRecursively calculate u_{t+1} = M^t * u_0.\nCalculate DAU, WAU, and MAU for each prediction day t = 1, …, T."

To get around this limitation, we shall first build a new user count prediction model that need not be very accurate (since in a realistic setting new user counts can also be a parameter that can be changed).\nThe information on new users on any given date is inherent in registration_date in the data.\n\nnew_users &lt;- dau_data %&gt;%\n  filter(date == registration_date) %&gt;%\n  group_by(date) %&gt;%\n  summarise(new_user_count = n()) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    year = year(date),\n    week_of_year = isoweek(date), # ISO 8601 week (Monday starts the week)\n    month = as.factor(month(date, label = TRUE, abbr = TRUE)), # Month as abbreviated name\n    day_of_week = wday(date)\n  )\n\nlmod &lt;- glm.nb(\n  new_user_count ~ year * bs(week_of_year, 4) + month + day_of_week,\n  data = new_users\n)\n\n# summary(lmod)\n\nAfter some experimentation, the model setup to predict future counts of new users is as above.  The counts are assumed Poisson but with a higher variance than normal due to spikes in the data and hence a negative binomial model has been used.  It was imperative that we used a robust version of GLM to be able to get relatively constant variance of errors, that were being caused due to outliers in user count towards beginning of every year.  The model appears to be doing a satisfactory job of predicting counts of new users and we consider this acceptable for further analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssigning states\nThere needs to be an assignment of one of the 7 states (mentioned earlier) against each date for a user.

It makes sense that current -&gt; current transition value is high. This means that active users tend to continue being active with high probability or otherwise become at_risk_wau.  It also seems sensible that there is no state from which one could transition to new. Apparantly quite a high proportion of dormant users stay dormant which could be one of the focuses of resurrection campaigns in such companies.\n\n\nPredicting DAU\nWe start with getting initial state counts for the date on which the dataset ends. This combined with M transition matrix should give us new state counts. We will be mindful to update new_user_count for all the days we would like to predict on. This is done using the prediction model developed earlier.\n\ndata_end_date &lt;- prediction_start_date - 1\nstate0 &lt;- states %&gt;%\n  filter(date == data_end_date) %&gt;%\n  group_by(state) %&gt;%\n  summarise(cnt = n(), .groups = 'drop')\n\nWe shall define a flexible mechanism to predict DAU, to enable changing prediction horizon. We will also supply a dataframe of new_users to this mechanism so that it may use predicted values for appropriate prediction dates.\n\npredict_dau &lt;- function(M, state0, start_date, end_date, new_users_predicted) {\n    dates &lt;- seq(as.Date(start_date), as.Date(end_date), by = \"day\")\n    # Align state0 name order with transition Matrix name order\n    new_dau &lt;- state0[match(state0$state, rownames(M)), ]$cnt\n    dau_pred &lt;- list()\n\n    for (dt in dates) {\n        new_dau &lt;- as.integer(t(M) %*% new_dau) # Transitions\n        new_users_today &lt;- new_users_predicted %&gt;%\n            filter(date == dt) %&gt;%\n            pull(predicted) %&gt;%\n            as.integer()\n        new_dau[5] &lt;- new_users_today # Today's new users get transitioned next day\n        dau_pred &lt;- append(dau_pred, list(new_dau))\n    }\n\n    df &lt;- data.frame(do.call(rbind, dau_pred))\n    colnames(df) &lt;- rownames(M)\n    df$date &lt;- dates\n    df$dau &lt;- df$new + df$current + df$reactivated + df$resurrected\n    df$wau &lt;- df$dau + df$at_risk_wau\n    df$mau &lt;- df$dau + df$at_risk_wau + df$at_risk_mau\n\n    return(tibble(df))\n}\n\ndau_predicted &lt;- predict_dau(\n  M,\n  state0,\n  prediction_start_date,\n  prediction_end_date,\n  new_users_predicted\n)\n\np &lt;- (ggplot(\n  dau_data %&gt;%\n    group_by(date) %&gt;%\n    summarise(DAU = n())\n) +\n  geom_line(aes(x = date, y = DAU)) +\n  geom_line(data = dau_predicted, aes(x = date, y = dau), colour = 'red') +\n  ggtitle('DAU Predictions'))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe prominent contributer to DAU counts are current users, who are aided by addition of new users everyday and the fact that current users stay active with a probability of 85% (from M matrix).  The prediction makes intuitive sense however the magnitude of spike certainly seems quite large.  Observing the shape of predicted DAU, it seems quite strongly influenced by predicted new user count from the model earlier. Additionally, some degree of experimentation with the predictions suggest that about 20% decrease in new user counts bring predicted DAU to comparable levels of previous years (dotted line in the plot)."

    "text": "Analysis\nThe response variable gamble is non‑negative and strongly right‑skewed. We therefore model log(gamble + 1). Adding £1 ensures the log is defined for zero spenders, keeps small expenditures near zero on the transformed scale, and avoids introducing artificial extreme negative values. Note this is different from a GLM with a log link: here we model the (logged) response directly, which changes how effects are interpreted on the original scale. \nObservation 24 (gamble = £156) appears to be an outlier and is removed from the analysis.\n\nEffect of Gender\nIt seems plausible that males are spending more on gambling compared to females. This is also indicated by the boxplot below. We will evaluate this hypothesis using a simple linear model with log(gamble + 1) as response and sex as explanatory variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis of Variance Table\n\nResponse: log_gamble\n          Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value   Pr(&gt;F)   \nsex        1 20.365  20.365  12.261 0.001074 **\nResiduals 44 73.085   1.661                    \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\nGender seems to have statistically significant association with gambling expenditure.  Anova procedure is equivalent to a t-test with constant variance assumption (Faraway 2025), which seems fair from the Boxplot above. They test for the same effect and result in identical p-values. \nBefore moving to analysing joint effect of Income and Gender, it is imperative to check if the effect of gender is not due to confounding by income. It could well be the case that individuals with higher income spend more on gambling. But then if high income itself is associated with gender, then the above effect of gender may be spurious.

Males spend about three times more than females on average (note: reporting biases could inflate this effect; boys may over-report and girls may under-report (Ide-Smith and Lea 1988)). A £1 increase in weekly income is associated with an approximate 19% increase in annual gambling expenditure on the log scale interpretation. The interaction between gender and income was not significant, suggesting the effect of income is similar across genders."

    "text": "Data\nThe data come from the mpg dataset (GGplot2 Development Team, n.d.). We focus on front‑wheel‑drive petrol cars in the compact, midsize, and subcompact classes to keep the comparison balanced. Because models were selected based on having new releases across 1999–2008 (used as a proxy for popularity), manufacturers appear in the sample according to availability rather than a strict experimental design. This affects whether manufacturers are best treated as random or fixed effects.\nOn one hand, manufacturers could be treated as random effects because they were not experimentally selected; on the other hand, we are interested in manufacturer‑specific differences, so treating manufacturers as fixed effects would be useful if each manufacturer is well represented. After filtering the data some manufacturers are missing or sparsely represented, so the scope of inference is limited — we can test whether manufacturers differ, but precise fixed‑effect estimates for every manufacturer would be unreliable.\nModels are treated as random and are nested inside manufacturers because the sample contains multiple models per manufacturer and the particular models present are effectively a random sample from all possible models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmanufacturer\nmodel\ndispl\nyear\ncyl\nmpg\nfl\nclass\ntrans\n\n\n\n\nchevrolet\nmalibu\n2.4\n2008\n4\n22\nr\nmidsize\nauto\n\n\nvolkswagen\njetta\n2.0\n2008\n4\n22\np\ncompact\nauto\n\n\nhyundai\ntiburon\n2.7\n2008\n6\n16\nr\nsubcompact\nmanual\n\n\nhyundai\ntiburon\n2.7\n2008\n6\n17\nr\nsubcompact\nmanual\n\n\nhonda\ncivic\n1.6\n1999\n4\n28\nr\nsubcompact\nmanual\n\n\nnissan\nmaxima\n3.0\n1999\n6\n18\nr\nmidsize\nauto\n\n\ntoyota\ncamry\n2.4\n2008\n4\n21\nr\nmidsize\nauto\n\n\nhonda\ncivic\n1.6\n1999\n4\n24\nr\nsubcompact\nauto\n\n\npontiac\ngrand prix\n3.1\n1999\n6\n18\nr\nmidsize\nauto\n\n\ntoyota\ncorolla\n1.8\n2008\n4\n26\nr\ncompact\nauto\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause of the way the data is collected, (selection of models which had a new release every year between 1999 and 2008 - this was used as a proxy for the popularity of the car), we need to be careful about how manufacturers are treated in the analysis. On one hand it seems only fair to treat manufacturers as also being random, since these were not specifically selected in the design of experiment (like car model these appear randomly in the data based on popularity criteria) (Faraway 2016). On the other hand, we are interested in the actual differences between manufacturers, so treating them as fixed effects is desirable.  However, to warrant the use of fixed effects for manufacturers, we need to have sufficient data for each manufacturer and post filtering, the data should have all the manufacturers of interest. As can be seen this is not the case. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt can be seen that several key manufacturers are missing from the final dataset, consequently we may only be able to answer question like Is the mpg among manufacturers significantly different ? as opposed to What is the average mpg of manufactuers to be able to compare them more directly  Of course, the car models are random in the study design, so we will treat them as such.

Although, it is definitely possible that this is driven by different models and their attributes more than manufacturers themselves. \nThe plot below suggests (to intuition) that with larger displacement the mpg reduces. Although there is a hint of nonlinearity in the trend, we shall ignore this initially.  Midsize cars are slightly less efficient (lower mpg) than compact and subcompact cars. This is expected since these are heavier with higher displacement engines.  It is hard to get an accurate read on the effect of transmission and so we shall defer it to the model to figure out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mpg distribution has a right skew, so we take the logarithm of mpg to stabilize variance and to make regression coefficients interpretable as approximate percentage changes."

    "text": "Conclusion\nWe set out to test whether manufacturers differ in city mpg after controlling for other attributes. Accounting for model‑level clustering, year and displacement, we find remaining manufacturer‑level variation in city mpg. In other words, even after controlling for model and engine size, manufacturers differ in typical city mpg. \nThe variability among manufacturers is of the order of +/- 6%, which translates to +/-1.2 mpg on average \nLimitations: this analysis is limited to petrol, front‑wheel‑drive cars in the compact/midsize/subcompact classes. Results should not be generalized beyond these groups without further study. Results are also sensitive to the treatment of manufacturers as random effects due to the sampling design."
