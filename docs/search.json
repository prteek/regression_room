    "text": "Analysis\n\nComparing recent vs old movies\nTo simplify the analysis we can consider more recent releases (2013-2023) and compare them to releases from much older timeframe (1990-2000).  The runtime distributions for movies in these 2 categories is different although not significantly (visually).\n\ntestset &lt;- yearly_top_movies %&gt;%\n    mutate(\n    label = case_when(\n      release_year &gt;= 2013 ~ \"recent\",\n      release_year &lt;= 2000 ~ \"old\",\n      TRUE ~ \"other\"\n    )) %&gt;% filter(label != \"other\")\n\nggplot(testset, aes(x=runtime_mins, fill=label)) + geom_density(alpha=0.3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we can compare runtimes between two periods. It would have been a straightforward exercise in testing the hypothesis of difference of means using a t-test had the distributions of runtimes been more normally distributed. \nAdditionally, the cutoff chosen for old (&lt;= 2000) and recent (&gt;=2013) are arbitrary. We would ideally want a more comprehensive statement about movie runtimes increasing over the years. \nNeverthless, as a preliminary (and simple) analysis we can use bootstrap to compare means of runtimes in the above groups.\n\nlibrary(boot)\n\n# Define a function to calculate the difference of means\ndiff_mean &lt;- function(data, indices) {\n  # Resample the data\n  resampled_data &lt;- data[indices, ]\n\n  # Calculate means for each group\n  mean_group1 &lt;- mean(resampled_data$runtime_mins[resampled_data$label == \"old\"])\n  mean_group2 &lt;- mean(resampled_data$runtime_mins[resampled_data$label == \"recent\"])\n\n  # Return the difference of means\n  return(mean_group2 - mean_group1)\n}\n\nset.seed(123)\nbootstrap_results &lt;- boot(data = testset, statistic = diff_mean, R = 1000)\n\n# Print bootstrap results\nprint(bootstrap_results)\n\n\nORDINARY NONPARAMETRIC BOOTSTRAP\n\n\nCall:\nboot(data = testset, statistic = diff_mean, R = 1000)\n\n\nBootstrap Statistics :\n    original     bias    std. error\nt1* 9.697248 0.06394496    3.174053\n\n# Plot bootstrap distribution\nplot(bootstrap_results)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Calculate confidence interval for the difference of means\nci &lt;- boot.ci(bootstrap_results, type = \"perc\")\nprint(ci)\n\nBOOTSTRAP CONFIDENCE INTERVAL CALCULATIONS\nBased on 1000 bootstrap replicates\n\nCALL : \nboot.ci(boot.out = bootstrap_results, type = \"perc\")\n\nIntervals : \nLevel     Percentile     \n95%   ( 3.502, 15.736 )  \nCalculations and Intervals on Original Scale\n\n\nIf we bootstrap the mean of movie times and take the difference between means of recent release years from old, there is evidence that blockbuster movies are getting longer in recent years, and the difference can be up to 10 min on average and can be expected to be between 4 min and 16 min. \nSo on your next visit to the theatre make sure to get some extra popcorn !!!\n\n\nEstimating effect of time\nIn the want of better precision in identifying the effect of time on movie runtimes, we can formulate a regression problem and estimate the effect of year.\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot above partly confirms our intuition about the increasing trend of runtime.\n\nlmod &lt;- lm(runtime_mins ~ release_year, yearly_top_movies)\nsummary(lmod)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = runtime_mins ~ release_year, data = yearly_top_movies)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-43.369 -19.617   0.488  16.422  77.834 \n\nCoefficients:\n              Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|)   \n(Intercept)  -636.1435   271.4520  -2.343  0.01969 * \nrelease_year    0.3791     0.1353   2.802  0.00537 **\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\nResidual standard error: 24.42 on 335 degrees of freedom\nMultiple R-squared:  0.0229,    Adjusted R-squared:  0.01999 \nF-statistic: 7.852 on 1 and 335 DF,  p-value: 0.005372\n\n\nThe regression above supports the hypothesis that release_year has positively contributed to movie runtimes at approximately 0.38 min/year.  Considering our previous finding on average between 1995 and 2018 the runtime increased by approx. 10 min. From the regression estimate the increase is 0.3791 * (2018-1995) = 8.7 min. \nWe can certainly run some diagnostics to be sure of our model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe residuals appear to have no pattern with fitted values and also have fairly constant variance. There are no significantly high leverage points or outliers.  However, the errors are not quite normally distributed.  This can be ignored by relying on large sample size and the fact that other diagnostics are fine.  But, we shall check if just in case any transformation of runtime_mins may help.\n\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(MASS))\nboxcox(lmod, lambda=seq(-1,1,by=0.1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Box-Cox transformation check above hints that there may be some benefit if we used log-transformation (since lambda approximately 0). This thread does not materialise into anything meaningful as upon transformation, the diagnostics do not change materially and the effect size of release_year is practically the same (0.32% per year, 0.38 min/year on base of 119 min). So we will not use any transformation in our model.\nThere may also be some degree of autocorrelation among residuals due to the fact that we’re working with timeseries data. We can test for this autocorrelation and handle it if necessary.\n\n\n[1] \"Auto-correlation among residuals: \" \"0.01\"                              \n\n\n\n    Durbin-Watson test\n\ndata:  runtime_mins ~ release_year\nDW = 1.982, p-value = 0.4126\nalternative hypothesis: true autocorrelation is greater than 0\n\n\nThere doesn’t appear to be significant autocorrelation and other model diagnotics appear to be fine."

    "text": "Methodology\nFirst we shall model the process as a Markov chain to see how well the approach predicts future user counts.  Subsequently, to validate MC approach and rethink the problem setup in want of simplification, we shall look to model the time-series as a regression problem. We shall do this respecting the mechanics of transition and see how far this can get us in terms of analysing and controlling the process.\nAt day d (d = 1, 2, … ) of a user’s lifetime, the user can be in one of the following 7 (mutually-exclusive) states: \n\nnew : learners who are experiencing Duolingo for the first time ever\ncurrent : learners active today, who were also active in the past week\nreactivated : learners active today, who were also active in the past month (but not the past week)\nresurrected : learners active today, who were last active &gt;30 days ago\nat_risk_wau (at risk weekly active users) : learners who have been active within the past week, but not today\nat_risk_mau (at risk monthly active users) : learners who were active within the past month, but not the past week\ndormant : learners who have been inactive for at least 30 days\n\nA brief overview of how these states are related is below:\n\n\n\nUser states and transitions\n\n\nThe transition acronyms are defined below:\n\nNURR : New User Retention Rate (The proportion of day 1 learners who return on day 2)\nCURR : Current User Retention Rate (This is not a 100%. Not all of current users stay active every day since people forget to complete a lesson, or have technical difficulties, or just want to take a break)\nRURR : Reactivated User Retention rate (The proportion of at_risk_mau who became active today)\nSURR : Resurrected User Retention rate (The proportion of dormant users who became active today)\niWAURR : The proportion of at_risk_wau users who became active today\n\nAs is evident, these quantities (along with others) are what will become the elements of Transition matrix (M), that we discuss next.\nIn keeping with the definition chart above, the next step is to consider user behaviour as a Markov chain.  Let M be a transition matrix associated with this Markov process: m(i, j) = P(s_j | s_i) are the probabilities that a user moves to state s_j right after being at state s_i. The matrix M is learned from the historical data.\nAssuming that user behavior is stationary (independent of time), the matrix M fully describes the states of all users in the future.\nSuppose that the vector u_0 of length 7 contains the counts of users in certain states on a given day (say day 0). According to the Markov model, on the next day (day 1), we expect to have the following number of users (u_1) in respective states:\n\n\n\nState transition counts estimation\n\n\nApplying this multiplication recursively, we can derive the number of users in any states on any arbitrary day t &gt; 0 in the future (call this vector u_t).\nNow, having u_t calculated, we can determine DAU, WAU and MAU values on day t:\n\nDAU_t = #New_t + #Current_t + #Reactivated_t + #Resurrected_t\nWAU_t = DAU_t + #AtRiskWau_t\nMAU_t = DAU_t + #AtRiskWau_t + #AtRiskMau_t\n\nFinally, here’s the algorithm outline:\n\nFor each prediction day t = 1, …, T, calculate the expected number of new users #New_1, …, #New_T.\nFor each lifetime day of each user, assign one of the 7 states.\nCalculate the transition matrix M from the historical data.\nCalculate initial state counts u_0 corresponding to day t=0.\nRecursively calculate u_{t+1} = M^t * u_0.\nCalculate DAU, WAU, and MAU for each prediction day t = 1, …, T."

To get around this limitation, we shall first build a new user count prediction model that need not be very accurate (since in a realistic setting new user counts can also be a parameter that can be changed).\nThe information on new users on any given date is inherent in registration_date in the data.\n\nnew_users &lt;- dau_data %&gt;%\n                filter(date==registration_date) %&gt;%\n                group_by(date) %&gt;%\n                summarise(new_user_count=n()) %&gt;%\n                mutate(\n                    year = year(date),\n                    week_of_year = isoweek(date),  # ISO 8601 week (Monday starts the week)\n                    month = as.factor(month(date, label = TRUE, abbr = TRUE)),  # Month as abbreviated name\n                    day_of_week = wday(date)\n\n                    )\n\nlmod &lt;- glm.nb(new_user_count ~ year * bs(week_of_year,4) + month + day_of_week , data=new_users)\n\n# summary(lmod)\n\nAfter some experimentation, the model setup to predict future counts of new users is as above.  The counts are assumed Poisson but with a higher variance than normal due to spikes in the data and hence a negative binomial model has been used.  It was imperative that we used a robust version of GLM to be able to get relatively constant variance of errors, that were being caused due to outliers in user count towards beginning of every year.  The model appears to be doing a satisfactory job of predicting counts of new users and we consider this acceptable for further analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssigning states\nThere needs to be an assignment of one of the 7 states (mentioned earlier) against each date for a user. This will help identify transitions made between states and populate the Transition matrix.

It makes sense that current -&gt; current transition value is high. This means that active users tend to continue being active with high probability or otherwise become at_risk_wau.  It also seems sensible that there is no state from which one could transition to new. Apparantly quite a high proportion of dormant users stay dormant which could be one of the focuses of resurrection campaigns in such companies.\n\n\nPredicting DAU\nWe start with getting initial state counts for the date on which the dataset ends. This combined with M transition matrix should give us new state counts. We will be mindful to update new_user_count for all the days we would like to predict on. This is done using the prediction model developed earlier.\n\ndata_end_date &lt;- prediction_start_date - 1\nstate0 &lt;- states %&gt;%\n            filter(date==data_end_date) %&gt;%\n            group_by(state) %&gt;%\n            summarise(cnt=n(), .groups='drop')\n\nWe shall define a flexible mechanism to predict DAU, to enable changing prediction horizon. We will also supply a dataframe of new_users to this mechanism so that it may use predicted values for appropriate prediction dates.\n\npredict_dau &lt;- function(M, state0, start_date, end_date, new_users_predicted) {\n    dates &lt;- seq(as.Date(start_date), as.Date(end_date), by = \"day\")\n    # Align state0 name order with transition Matrix name order\n    new_dau &lt;- state0[match(state0$state, rownames(M)), ]$cnt\n    dau_pred &lt;- list()\n\n    for (dt in dates) {\n        new_dau &lt;- as.integer(t(M) %*% new_dau) # Transitions\n        new_users_today &lt;- new_users_predicted %&gt;%\n            filter(date == dt) %&gt;%\n            pull(predicted) %&gt;%\n            as.integer()\n        new_dau[5] &lt;- new_users_today # Today's new users get transitioned next day\n        dau_pred &lt;- append(dau_pred, list(new_dau))\n    }\n\n    df &lt;- data.frame(do.call(rbind, dau_pred))\n    colnames(df) &lt;- rownames(M)\n    df$date &lt;- dates\n    df$dau &lt;- df$new + df$current + df$reactivated + df$resurrected\n    df$wau &lt;- df$dau + df$at_risk_wau\n    df$mau &lt;- df$dau + df$at_risk_wau + df$at_risk_mau\n\n    return(tibble(df))\n}\n\ndau_predicted &lt;- predict_dau(M, state0, prediction_start_date, prediction_end_date, new_users_predicted)\n\np &lt;- (ggplot(dau_data %&gt;%\n        group_by(date) %&gt;%\n        summarise(DAU=n())\n        ) +\ngeom_line(aes(x=date, y=DAU)) +\ngeom_line(data=dau_predicted, aes(x=date, y=dau), colour='red') +\nggtitle('DAU Predictions')\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe prominent contributer to DAU counts are current users, who are aided by addition of new users everyday and the fact that current users stay active with a probability of 85% (from M matrix).  The prediction makes intuitive sense however the magnitude of spike certainly seems quite large.  Observing the shape of predicted DAU, it seems quite strongly influenced by predicted new user count from the model earlier. Additionally, some degree of experimentation with the predictions suggest that about 20% decrease in new user counts bring predicted DAU to comparable levels of previous years."
