<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>I recently came across an article posing a question:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Are blockbusters getting (reely) longer?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fueled by the buzz around Christopher Nolanâ€™s <em>Oppenheimer</em> being his longest movie (just over 3 hours), I decided to explore this question using publicly available data.</p>
<p>As an exercise in inference this question can be answered with some analysis. I fetched top grossing movies in each year from <em>boxoffice mojo</em> and movie details from <em>imdb</em> and combined them to create the following dataset.</p>

<p>If we bootstrap the mean of movie times and take the difference between means of release year 2022 from release years 1990-2000, there is evidence that blockbuster movies are getting longer in recent years, and the difference can be up to 20 min. <br></p>
<p>So on your next visit to the theatre make sure to get some extra popcorn.</p>
